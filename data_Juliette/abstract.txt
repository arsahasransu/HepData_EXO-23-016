The CERN LHC Run 3 (2022--2026) physics program of the CMS experiment expands the scope of the search for long-lived particles with the addition of dedicated and the improvement of the existing triggers. These customized triggers and their performance are described in this paper, using several theoretical benchmark models that extend the standard model of particle physics, based on proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector during 2022--2024 at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV.
